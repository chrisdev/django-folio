Django-folio
=============

django-folio is a reusable Django app for show information about work projects.  
Projects have attributes such as the 
company it was done for, url etc. You can associate images, files (for e.g white paper) , 
videos as well as recommendations with projects as well as categorize (website, logo, illustration) 
as well as identify 
particular features of a project e.g (skills e.g Graphic Designs, Django or attribute of a project)

This project was forked from https://github.com/howiworkdaily/django-portfolio however, we 
decided change the name since there was another project on pypi 
with the same name but with a very different focus.
